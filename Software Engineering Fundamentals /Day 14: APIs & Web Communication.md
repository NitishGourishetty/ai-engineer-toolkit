To wrap up this module, youâ€™ll learn how applications talk to each other using APIs. Whether youâ€™re pulling data from OpenAI or saving chat history to a server, APIs are the glue that connects everything together. Youâ€™ll also explore REST vs GraphQL, giving you insight into how modern apps move data across the web. This ties together everything youâ€™ve learnedâ€”from development to deploymentâ€”with real-world communication between tools.

### What is an API?

An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

- Enables communication between software systems
- Defines methods and data formats for interaction
- Abstracts complex functionality behind simple interfaces
- Powers modern web and mobile applications

### API Fundamentals

### API Visualization:

This diagram shows how your application connects to various external services (AI, Weather, Database) through API requests and responses.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Your Application] -->|API Request| B[AI Service]
    B -->|API Response| A
    A -->|API Request| C[Weather Service]
    C -->|API Response| A
    A -->|API Request| D[Database Service]
    D -->|API Response| A

```

### REST vs GraphQL APIs

### REST APIs:

- **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer
- Resource-based architecture
- Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Each endpoint represents a resource

```
https://api.example.com/users         # Get all users
https://api.example.com/users/42      # Get user with ID 42
https://api.example.com/users/42/posts # Get posts from user 42

```

### GraphQL APIs:

- Query language for APIs
- Single endpoint for all operations
- Client specifies exactly what data it needs
- Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching
- Advantages for AI applications with varying data needs

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "42") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      createdAt
    }
  }
}

```

### Comparison:

| Feature | REST | GraphQL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endpoints | Multiple | Single |
| Data Fetching | Can over/under fetch | Request exactly what you need |
| Caching | Built into HTTP | Requires additional setup |
| File Uploads | Native support | Requires special handling |
| Learning Curve | Moderate | Steeper |
| Usage in AI | Common for simple AI services | Good for complex AI data needs |

### HTTP Basics

### HTTP Methods:

Shows the four main HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT/DELETE, DELETE) and what each one does in an API context.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[GET] -->|"Retrieve data (safe, no side effects)"| B[Example: Get user profile]
    C[POST] -->|"Create new resources"| D[Example: Create new AI prediction]
    E[PUT/PATCH] -->|"Update existing resources"| F[Example: Update AI model settings]
    G[DELETE] -->|"Remove resources"| H[Example: Delete saved prediction]

```

### Common Status Codes:

- **2xx Success**
    - 200: OK
    - 201: Created
    - 204: No Content
- **4xx Client Errors**
    - 400: Bad Request
    - 401: Unauthorized
    - 404: Not Found
- **5xx Server Errors**
    - 500: Internal Server Error
    - 503: Service Unavailable

### Working with APIs in Practice

*Note - If you are new to API calls, copy these blocks of code into Cursor and prompt in the chat to explain the code to familiarize this structure.* 

### Making API Requests (JavaScript/TypeScript):

Demonstrates making an asynchronous API call using fetch, with proper error handling and authentication headers.

```tsx
// Using fetch API
async function getAIPrediction(inputText: string): Promise<any> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.aiservice.com/predict', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ text: inputText })
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`API error: ${response.status}`);
    }

    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to get AI prediction:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Usage
getAIPrediction("Analyze this customer feedback")
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));

```

### Using Axios Library:

Shows an alternative way to make API calls using the Axios library, with similar structure but cleaner syntax.

```tsx
import axios from 'axios';

async function classifyImage(imageUrl: string): Promise<any> {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('https://api.aiservice.com/image/classify', {
      url: imageUrl
    }, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
      }
    });

    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Image classification failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

```

### API Authentication Methods:

Three code snippets showing different ways to authenticate API requests: API keys, Bearer tokens, and OAuth 2.0.

1. **API Keys**
    
    ```tsx
    headers: {
      'X-API-Key': 'your_api_key_here'
    }
    
    ```
    
2. **Bearer Tokens (JWT)**
    
    ```tsx
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...'
    }
    
    ```
    
3. **OAuth 2.0**
    
    ```tsx
    // First get a token, then use it in requests
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    }
    
    ```
    

### Practice Activities:

1. **API Exploration:**
    - Test public APIs using Postman or similar tools
2. **API Request Challenge:**
    - Write code to fetch and display data from a simple API
3. **AI API Simulation:**
    - Create a mock AI service API and client application

In the bootcamp, you'll combine all these concepts to build production-ready AI applications with:

### Modern Application Architecture:

Illustrates the complete architecture of an AI application with user-facing components, API layer, AI processing, and data storage all working together.

```mermaid

        State[State Management]
    end

    subgraph "API Layer"

        Cache[Response Cache]
    end

    subgraph "Data Layer"
        DB[Database]
        Storage[File Storage]
    end

    UI <-->|User Interaction| State
