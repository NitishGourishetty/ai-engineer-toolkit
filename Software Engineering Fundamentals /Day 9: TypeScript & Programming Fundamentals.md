Today youâ€™ll learn the essentials of programming with TypeScript, a powerful language that helps catch bugs early and write clearer code. Weâ€™ll walk through variables, types, functions, and other core concepts. This gives you the quick primer needed to build secure and scalable AI applications, especially as you start connecting interfaces, APIs, and business logic.

### Why TypeScript for AI Applications?

TypeScript adds strong typing to JavaScript, which is particularly valuable when working with AI applications:

- **Type Safety:** Ensures data consistency between different system components
- **Better Documentation:** Types serve as built-in documentation
- **Error Detection:** Catches errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **IDE Support:** Better autocomplete and suggestions while coding

### TypeScript Fundamentals

*If you are new to programming, copy these blocks of code into Cursor and prompt in the chat to explain the code so that you can familiarize the high level concepts. You will be diving deeper into the usage of these concepts during hands on activities in the bootcamp.* 

*Dont worry, only a high level understanding is needed for now. You will get a much more comprehensive walk through regarding using Typescript for AI applications in the bootcamp.* 

### Basic Types:

Demonstrates TypeScript's primitive types (string, boolean, number) and special types (any, unknown) with simple examples.

```tsx
// Basic primitive types
let userName: string = "AI Student";
let isEnrolled: boolean = true;
let studentCount: number = 25;
let notFound: undefined = undefined;
let notSet: null = null;

// Special types
let anything: any = "I can be anything";
let unknown: unknown = 4;  // More type-safe than any

```

### Arrays and Collections:

Shows different ways to define typed arrays in TypeScript, including standard arrays, alternate syntax, and tuples.

```tsx
// Arrays
let topics: string[] = ["AI", "TypeScript", "APIs"];
let scores: number[] = [98, 87, 92];

// Alternate array syntax
let alternatives: Array<string> = ["Option A", "Option B"];

// Tuples (fixed-length arrays with specific types)
let userStatus: [string, boolean] = ["active", true];

```

### Objects & Interfaces:

Illustrates how to define object types directly and using interfaces, including optional properties.

```tsx
// Object with inline type
let student: {name: string, level: string} = {
  name: "Alex",
  level: "Beginner"
};

// Interface definition
interface Course {
  title: string;
  duration: number;
  isRequired: boolean;
  tags?: string[];  // Optional property
}

// Using the interface
const aiCourse: Course = {
  title: "AI Product Engineering",
  duration: 8,
  isRequired: true,
  tags: ["AI", "engineering", "product"]
};

```

### Functions:

Demonstrates defining functions with typed parameters and return values, including arrow functions and void returns.

```tsx
// Function with typed parameters and return type
function calculateScore(correct: number, total: number): number {
  return (correct / total) * 100;
}

// Arrow function with types
const isPassingGrade = (score: number): boolean => score >= 70;

// Function that doesn't return anything
function logActivity(activity: string): void {
  console.log(`User performed: ${activity}`);
}

```

### TypeScript for AI Applications

**Typing AI Model Responses:**

Shows how to create interfaces for AI model responses and functions that handle them based on confidence levels.

```tsx
// Interface for AI model response
interface AIModelResponse {
  prediction: string;
  confidence: number;
  processingTime: number;
  alternatives?: string[];
  modelVersion: string;
}

// Function that processes AI response
function handleAIResponse(response: AIModelResponse): void {
  if (response.confidence > 0.9) {
    console.log(`High confidence prediction: ${response.prediction}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Low confidence (${response.confidence}). Consider alternatives: ${response.alternatives?.join(", ")}`);
  }
}

// Example usage
const mockAIResponse: AIModelResponse = {
  prediction: "positive sentiment",
  confidence: 0.87,
  processingTime: 0.045,
  alternatives: ["neutral sentiment", "mixed sentiment"],
  modelVersion: "sentiment-1.2.0"
};

handleAIResponse(mockAIResponse);

```

**Type Definitions for API Data:**

Creates structured interfaces for AI text analysis requests and responses, with nested types for different analysis components.

```tsx
// User input for AI text analysis
interface TextAnalysisRequest {
  text: string;
  language?: string;
  analysisTypes: ("sentiment" | "entities" | "keywords" | "summary")[];
  maxResults?: number;
}

// AI service response
interface TextAnalysisResponse {
  requestId: string;
  language: string;
  sentiment?: {
    label: "positive" | "negative" | "neutral" | "mixed";
    score: number;
  };
  entities?: Array<{
    text: string;
    type: string;
    confidence: number;
  }>;
  keywords?: string[];
  summary?: string;
  processingTime: number;
}

```

### Practice Activities in Cursor:

1. **Type Definition Exercise:**
    - Create interfaces for an AI-powered image recognition system
2. **Function Typing:**
    - Write typed functions to process and transform AI predictions
3. **Mock API Response:**
    - Define types and create mock AI analysis results for a review classification system

*Remember to add system rules in your Cursor set up (covered in Module 1) so that it can explain the code blocks as you vibe code these example to help you get familiarized.*

## ðŸš€Â Beyond the Fundamentals - Â From Concepts to Creation

The bootcamp takes you far beyond these basics with:

- Advanced TypeScript patterns specifically designed for AI applications
- Real-world AI integration challenges and solutions
- Performance optimization techniques for AI-powered applications
- Collaborative development workflows for AI engineering teams

by: 

- **Creating type-safe AI interfaces** that eliminate runtime errors when processing model responses
- **Building intelligent error handling** that gracefully manages AI uncertainty and edge cases
- **Developing reusable AI components** with TypeScript generics for different model types
- **Implementing advanced type patterns** for complex AI data flows

### The TypeScript Advantage in AI

In the bootcamp, we'll explore how TypeScript's type system helps you:

- **Model AI uncertainty** with sophisticated typing patterns
- **Ensure data integrity** across your entire AI application stack
- **Create self-documenting code** that makes your AI logic transparent
- **Catch integration issues** before they become production problems

### Hands-On Development

You won't just learn concepts - you'll apply them by:

1. Building a complete RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system with type-safe interfaces
2. Implementing streaming AI responses with strong typing throughout
3. Creating intelligent validation layers for AI inputs and outputs
4. Developing production-ready error handling for AI model interactions
