## üìö Section 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

### GitHub Setup

**1. Create a GitHub Account**

- Register at [github.com](https://github.com/)
- Choose a free plan
- üîó¬†[Learn the basics of Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey)
- üîó GitHub Docs: [Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world)
- [Optional] [Set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for security](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)

**2. Configure SSH/HTTPs for GitHub**

- üìπ¬†[Connecting GitHub to your local environment (via HTTPS/SSH)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Connecting+GitHub+to+your+local+environment+(via+HTTPS%2FSSH)&oq=Connecting+GitHub+to+your+local+environment+(via+HTTPS%2FSSH)&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRifBTIHCAIQIRifBTIHCAMQIRifBTIHCAQQIRifBdIBBzQ4OWowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:1c41ebf3,vid:Msw7WJPqS34,st:0)
- Test your connection to GitHub
    - **SSH**:
    
    ```bash
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```
    
    - **HTTPS**:
    
    ```bash
    curl -I https://github.com
    ```
    
    ‚úÖ If the connection is successful, you'll see either a greeting (SSH) or a response like `HTTP/2 200`(HTTPS).
    

### Terminal Setup

The terminal is your command center. It lets you interact directly with your computer‚Äôs operating system, manage files, run programs, and most importantly ‚Äî work with Git. Here are the foundational commands you need to know.

**1. Choose & Configure Your Terminal**

- **Windows**: Install Windows Terminal or Git Bash
- **macOS**: Use Terminal or install iTerm2
- **Linux**: Use your distribution's terminal

**2. Essential Terminal Commands**

- **Navigation Commands:**

These help you move around your file system quickly and see what‚Äôs inside each folder.

| Command | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cd` | **Change directory** ‚Äì move between folders. | `cd my-project` |
| `ls` | **List contents** of a directory. | `ls` or `ls -la` |
| `pwd` | **Print working directory** ‚Äì shows your current location in the system. | `pwd` |
- **File and Folder Management:**

When coding, you‚Äôll constantly be adding, renaming, and organizing files. Mastering these saves time and keeps your project neat.

| Command | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mkdir` | **Make directory** ‚Äì create a new folder. | `mkdir src` |
| `touch` | **Create a file** quickly. | `touch index.ts` |
| `rm` | **Remove file or folder** (`-r` for folders). Be careful! | `rm oldfile.txt` or `rm -r old_folder` |
| `cp` | **Copy files** or directories. | `cp main.py backup.py` |
| `mv` | **Move or rename** files. | `mv temp.txt notes.txt` |

## üìö Section 2: Version Control with Git

### Git Fundamentals

**1. What is Version Control?**

**The Problem Version Control Solves**

- **Code History & Tracking**: Ever saved multiple versions of a file like "final.doc", "final_v2.doc", "really_final.doc"? Version control eliminates this by tracking all changes in a structured way.
- **Collaboration Challenges**: Without version control, team members might overwrite each other's work or struggle to merge changes from multiple contributors.
- **Backup & Recovery**: Provides a complete history that serves as both documentation and backup, allowing you to recover previous states if something goes wrong.
- **Experimentation Safety**: Enables developers to try new ideas without fear, as they can always revert to previous working versions.

**2. How Git Tracks Changes Over Time**

- **Snapshots, Not Differences**: Unlike other systems that store differences between files, Git takes a "snapshot" of all files at each commit
- **The Three States of Git**:
    - **Working Directory**: Where you modify files
    - **Staging Area** (Index): Where you prepare changes for a commit
    - **Repository**: The .git directory storing all versions
- **Commit Hash**: Every commit gets a unique identifier (hash) based on its contents
- **Branching Model**: Git uses lightweight branches that make parallel development easy

*Main and Development Branches*

### Installing Git

**1. Installation Instructions by Operating System**

**For Windows:**

1. Download the installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Run the installer with default options (customize if needed)
3. Important options to consider:
    - Default editor (recommend VS Code or Notepad++ for beginners)
    - PATH environment (recommend "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software")

**For macOS:**

1. **Option 1 - Homebrew** (recommended):

```bash

brew install git
```

1. **Option 2 - Standalone Installer**:
    - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Run the .dmg installer and follow prompts
2. **Option 3 - Command Line Tools**:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**2. Initial Git Configuration**

After installing Git, set up your identity with the following commands:

```bash

# Set your name (appears in commit history)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set your email (links commits to your GitHub account)
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**3. Verifying Your Installation**

Check that Git is properly installed by running:

```bash

git --version
```

You should see something like:

```

git version 2.41.0
```

View your configuration settings:

```bash
git config --list
```

Basic test to ensure Git is working:

```bash

# Create a test repository
mkdir git-test
cd git-test
git init

# You should see a message about initializing a repository# and a .git directory will be created
```

**Common Installation Troubleshooting:**

- **"Command not found"**: Git isn't in your PATH. Try restarting your terminal or adding Git to your PATH manually.
- **Permission issues**: Try running the commands with administrator privileges (sudo on Mac/Linux).
- **SSL certificate problems**: May need to disable SSL verification temporarily or update certificates.

**Resources for Further Help:**

- Official Git documentation: [git-scm.com/doc](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- GitHub's Git guides: [docs.github.com/en/get-started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

With Git properly installed and configured, you're ready to start tracking changes and collaborating on projects!

**üìù Core Git Commands**

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main
git pull origin main
```

### Essential Git Commands

**1. Repository Management**

- `git init`: Creates a new Git repository in the current directory, adding a hidden .git folder to track changes.
- `git clone [url]`: Downloads a complete copy of an existing repository, including all files and history.
- `git remote`: Lists, adds, or removes connections to other repositories (like GitHub) for sharing code.

**2. Tracking Changes**

- `git status`: Shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked in your working directory.
- `git add [file]`: Adds changes from your working directory to the staging area, preparing them for commit.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Records staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message.
- `git diff`: Displays line-by-line changes between your working directory and the last commit.

**3. Branching & Merging**

- `git branch [name]`: Creates a new branch to develop features or fix bugs independently from the main codebase.
- `git checkout [branch]`/`git switch [branch]`: Switches your working directory to a different branch.
- `git merge [branch]`: Integrates changes from one branch into your current branch.
- Resolving merge conflicts: Manually editing files where Git can't automatically combine different changes.

**4. Remote Operations**

- `git fetch`: Downloads objects and refs from a remote repository without merging changes into your branches.
- `git pull`: Fetches changes from a remote repository and automatically merges them into your current branch.
- `git push`: Uploads your local commits to a remote repository, sharing your changes with others.
- `git pull origin main` fetches the latest changes from the `main` branch on GitHub and merges them into your local code.

## Additional software engineering practice concepts

### ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD ‚Äì *Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment*

**Goal:** Automate building, testing, and deploying your app to reduce errors and speed up development.

üîπ **Continuous Integration (CI)**

- Automatically run tests when code is pushed to a shared repo (like GitHub).
- Ensures new code **doesn't break** the existing app.
- Common tools: **GitHub Actions, GitLab CI**

Think of this like a spell-checker that auto-checks your writing before you share it.

---

üîπ **Continuous Deployment (CD)**

- Automatically deploys your code to production **after it passes tests**.
- Can be:
    - **Continuous Delivery** (manual deploy after approval)
    - **Continuous Deployment** (fully automatic)

Think of this like hitting ‚Äúpublish‚Äù on a blog that instantly updates the live website after spell-check.

### üïµÔ∏è Observability ‚Äì *Understanding What‚Äôs Happening in Your App*

**Goal:** Know when something breaks, why it broke, and how to fix it.

üî∏ 1. **Logging**

- Records events (e.g., ‚ÄúUser X sent request Y‚Äù)
- Helps debug when something goes wrong.

üî∏ 2. **Monitoring**

- Tracks system health (CPU, memory, API uptime)
- Real-time alerts if something fails.

üî∏ 3. **Tracing**

- Tracks **how a request flows** through your system (frontend ‚Üí backend ‚Üí DB)
- Useful in microservices or distributed AI pipelines.
