Today is all about understanding the costs behind running real-world AI applications. From OpenAI API tokens to vector database storage, you‚Äôll break down pricing models and learn how to estimate usage and expenses. After deploying your first tool, this helps you make smart, budget-conscious decisions as you continue building.

## üöÄ Deployment (with Vercel)

In the bootcamp, you won‚Äôt just build cool AI tools‚Äîyou‚Äôll **deploy** them to the internet so anyone can try them out. Meet your future best friend: **Vercel**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How Vercel Works

1. Connect your GitHub repo to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
2. Every time you `git push`, Vercel:
    - Runs build commands
    - Deploys your code
    - Gives you a live URL to test + share

3. You can preview changes before going live.

> üí° Zero DevOps Required ‚Äî Vercel handles servers, scaling, SSL, and builds for you.
> 

Just **push to GitHub**, and your app is live within seconds.

### üß≠ When You‚Äôll Use This

Once your RAG or agent-based tool is working locally, you‚Äôll:

- Push your repo to GitHub
- Connect that repo to Vercel
- Share your deployed project with the world

### üß™ Bonus: Environment Variables

Need to hide secret keys (like OpenAI keys)? You‚Äôll store them securely in Vercel‚Äôs **Environment Variables** dashboard.

## üß± Other Deployment Options (What Comes After Vercel?)

While **Vercel** is perfect for fast, frontend-first AI apps, here are other options you may explore as your projects grow in complexity or scale.

---

### üê≥ **Docker (Containerized Deployments)**

**Use when**: You want full control over your app's environment and dependencies (especially for custom Python backends or ML models).

- **How it works**: Package your app and its environment into a portable ‚Äúcontainer.‚Äù
- **Deploy with**: Render, Railway, or self-hosted on VPS (e.g., DigitalOcean, Linode).
- **Great for**:
    - Python + Node combos
    - RAG pipelines using LangChain + vector DBs
    - Apps with GPU requirements

> üîí You control everything‚Äîfrom Python version to system libraries.
>

### üß∞ **Render / Railway / Fly.io**

**Use when**: You want backend flexibility (e.g., running Flask/FastAPI or background workers), but with a **Vercel-like simplicity**.

- Good for apps that need:
    - Custom ports
    - Background jobs
    - Scheduled tasks (cron)

---

### üè¢ **Enterprise-Grade Deployment**

**Use when**: You‚Äôre deploying inside a large company or working with sensitive data.

### üîß Tools:

- **AWS / GCP / Azure** (Cloud providers)
- **Kubernetes (K8s)** ‚Äì for scalable, container-based infra
- **CI/CD Pipelines** ‚Äì with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.
- **Terraform / Pulumi** ‚Äì for infrastructure-as-code

### üíº Considerations:

- Data privacy
- Team access control
- Custom DNS, load balancers, staging environments

---

### üì¶ **Streamlit / Gradio / Hugging Face Spaces**

**Use when**: You want to quickly demo or prototype ML/AI projects with a **friendly UI**.

- One-click deployment for ML models or interactive dashboards.
- Excellent for sharing proof-of-concept tools.
